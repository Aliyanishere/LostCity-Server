This is a higher-level repository that links our other projects. You'll notice it's like home-rolled submodules (without commit references).  
Github won't include submodules in web downloads, and we have a lot of users who end up clicking download zip.

## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you run into issues, please see our [common issues](#common-issues).

1. Download and extract this repo somewhere on your computer.
2. Install our [dependencies](#dependencies).
3. Open the folder you downloaded: **Run the start script and follow the on-screen prompts.** You may disregard any severity warnings you see.

Once your setup process has completed, wait for it to tell you the world has started before trying to play at: http://localhost/rs2.cgi

You can press `ctrl + c` to cancel/quit out of a terminal process.

## Dependencies

- Git CLI - Windows users: [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJS 22](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Java 17 or newer](https://adoptium.net/)

> [!TIP]
> If you're using VS Code (recommended), [we have an extension to install on the marketplace.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2004scape.runescriptlanguage)

## Workflow

**Use the start script provided** - it handles a lot of common use cases. We're trying to reduce the barrier to entry by providing an all-inclusive script.

## Common Issues

* `bad option: --import`  

You are using an older version of Node. Reinstall and re-run.

* `'"java"' is not recognized as an internal or external command`  

You do not have Java installed.

* `XXXXX has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 61.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0`  

You are using Java 8 or Java 11. If you have multiple Java versions, you will need to set `JAVA_PATH=path-to-java.exe` in your .env file.
